# APM-w-tidy
 Applied predictive modeling exercises, but adapted to work with tidymodels and tidyverse. 
 APM was written by Max Kuhn and focuses mostly on the Caret package for modeling. However that package is no longer being developed, and instead the tidymodels package has taken its place (also written by Kuhn). 
 
 This is a personal project to work my way through the original text, while also updating the examples to work in the tidyverse framework.
 
 Will try to note any deviations from the examples and exercises as specified in the main text, and also specify when I'm using packages different from those that were used in the original version
