## Working through the tidymodels documentation

Was pretty slow going working through the APM text and trying to update it without having a strong basis in the syntax for tidymodels. So I'm going to take a step back and go through the simple tutorials here for tidymodels.

Link:https://www.tidymodels.org/start/models/

```{r sea urchin data}
urchins <-
  # Data were assembled for a tutorial 
  # at https://www.flutterbys.com.au/stats/tut/tut7.5a.html
  read_csv("https://tidymodels.org/start/models/urchins.csv") %>% 
  # Change the names to be a little more verbose
  setNames(c("food_regime", "initial_volume", "width")) %>%
  # Factors are very helpful for modeling, so we convert one column
  mutate(food_regime = factor(food_regime, levels = c("Initial", "Low", "High")))

skimr::skim(urchins)

```

## Including Plots

```{r data checking}
ggplot(urchins, aes(x=initial_volume, y=width, color = food_regime)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm,se=FALSE)+
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = .7) #nice trick for making colors better

```

Build and fit a simple model. Note that this model contains the normal lm model features in lm_fit$fit. This is an anova model looking at the interaction between the variables as well
```{r}
lm_mod <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

lm_fit <-  lm_mod %>% 
  fit(width ~initial_volume * food_regime,data = urchins)

tidy(lm_fit) %>%
  dwplot(dot_args = list(size =2, color = "black"),
         whisker_args = list(color = "black"),
         vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey50", linetype = 2))
```

#Using some of the extra parsnip features
One major benefit is all the tidy models can calculate the variability using a common syntax, instead of having to rewrite every time.

```{r}
new_points <- expand.grid(initial_volume = 20, food_regime=c("Initial", "Low", "High"))

mean_pred <-  predict(lm_fit,new_data = new_points)
conf_int_pred <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = new_points, type="conf_int")

#bind data together, this is the power of tidy
plot_data <- new_points %>%
  bind_cols(mean_pred) %>%
  bind_cols(conf_int_pred)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x= food_regime)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=.pred)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = .pred_lower, ymax = .pred_upper), width = .2) + 
  labs(y="urchin size")

```

Changing the model engine: using a bayesian model (our old friend stan). This does the same thing as abve using a bayesian approach, but it's possible that it's like, really slow. Especially on my laptop.

```{r}
# set the prior distribution
prior_dist <- rstanarm::student_t(df = 1)

set.seed(123)

# make the parsnip model
bayes_mod <-   
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("stan", 
             prior_intercept = prior_dist, 
             prior = prior_dist) 

# train the model
bayes_fit <- 
  bayes_mod %>% 
  fit(width ~ initial_volume * food_regime, data = urchins)

print(bayes_fit, digits = 5)

bayes_plot_data <- 
  new_points %>% 
  bind_cols(predict(bayes_fit, new_data = new_points)) %>% 
  bind_cols(predict(bayes_fit, new_data = new_points, type = "conf_int"))

ggplot(bayes_plot_data, aes(x = food_regime)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = .pred)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = .pred_lower, ymax = .pred_upper), width = .2) + 
  labs(y = "urchin size") + 
  ggtitle("Bayesian model with t(1) prior distribution")
```
The useful idea around the whole tidymodels framework is to standardizethe interfaces with models. That means you can change the whole model (as using the stan approach here) but keep everything else the same. Super useful for iterating model development.

## Using recipes to pre-process data

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
set.seed(123)
data(flights)
flight_data <- flights %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert the arrival delay to a factor
    arr_delay = ifelse(arr_delay >= 30, "late", "on_time"),
    arr_delay = factor(arr_delay),
    # We will use the date (not date-time) in the recipe below
    date = as.Date(time_hour)
  ) %>% 
  # Include the weather data
  inner_join(weather, by = c("origin", "time_hour")) %>% 
  # Only retain the specific columns we will use
  select(dep_time, flight, origin, dest, air_time, distance, 
         carrier, date, arr_delay, time_hour) %>% 
  # Exclude missing data
  na.omit() %>% 
  # For creating models, it is better to have qualitative columns
  # encoded as factors (instead of character strings)
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) #I updated this to use the new standard with across instead of 

skimr::skim(flight_data)
```

```{r}
set.seed(555)
data_split <-  initial_split(flight_data, prop = .75)

train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

flights_rec <-  recipe(arr_delay ~., data = train_data) %>%
  update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = "ID") #this is used to keep these variables in the data but not use them for the model. 

summary(flights_rec)

#feature engineering as part of recipe
flights_rec <- recipe(arr_delay ~., data = train_data) %>%
  update_role(flight, time_hour, new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_date(date,features = c("dow","month")) %>%
  step_holiday(date, holidays = timeDate::listHolidays("US")) %>%
  step_rm(date) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) #removes any features with only one value

test <- prep(flights_rec)

summary(test)

```

Step of making a model happen in tidymodels
1. Process the recipe using the training set
2. Apply the recipe to the training set
3. Apply the recipe to the test set

We generally put these steps into a workflow, which pairs the model to a recipe. You can then pull out individual components later if you want, rather than running the prep function like I did above to look at things. It's possible that this is quite slow because I'm trying to fit the model with 169 predictors on 8G ram. So maybe don't waste a bunch of time on this. 

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm")

flights_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(lr_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(flights_rec)

flights_workflow

flights_fit <- flights_workflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)

flights_fit %>% pull_workflow_fit() %>% tidy()
```
Using the trained model for prediction is one more step

```{r}
flights_pred <- predict(flights_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data %>% select(arr_delay, time_hour, flight))

flights_pred

#evaluate using AUC

flights_pred %>% roc_curve(truth = arr_delay, .pred_late) %>%
  autoplot()

flights_pred %>% roc_auc(truth = arr_delay, .pred_late)
```

# Evaluate your model with resampling

```{r setting up data}
library(modeldata)

data("cells")

glimpse(cells)

cells %>% count(class) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

set.seed(123)
cell_split <- initial_split(cells %>% select(-case), strata = class)

cell_train <- training(cell_split)
cell_test <- testing(cell_split)

```
fitting a random forest model. There is no recipe used for this model, since random forest handles variable weirdness pretty well and you don't need to do a ton of preprocessing. Note that I expect this to be pretty slow on a laptop... aaand it's not. Like 5 seconds.

```{r}
rf_mod <- rand_forest(trees = 1000) %>%
  set_engine("ranger") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

set.seed(234)
rf_fit <-  rf_mod %>%
  fit(class ~.,data = cell_train)
rf_fit

```

Estimating performance:
Going to use AUC and classification accuracy
**Note that in the tidyverse the folds are referred to as having 'analysis' and 'assessment' subsets)**


```{r}
set.seed(345)
folds <-  vfold_cv(cell_train, v=10)

rf_wf <-  workflow()%>%
  add_model(rf_mod) %>%
  add_formula(class ~.)

set.seed(456)
rf_fit_rs <- rf_wf %>%
  fit_resamples(folds)

collect_metrics(rf_fit_rs)

rf_testing_pred <- 
  predict(rf_fit, cell_test) %>% 
  bind_cols(predict(rf_fit, cell_test, type = "prob")) %>% 
  bind_cols(cell_test %>% select(class))

rf_testing_pred %>%                   # test set predictions
  roc_auc(truth = class, .pred_PS)

rf_testing_pred %>%                   # test set predictions
  accuracy(truth = class, .pred_class)
```
## Model tuning
Lets make a decision tree and tune the parameters to get it working well

```{r}
library(vip)
#note that thi is using the same cell data from before, so if starting from here you'll need to reload it

tune_spec <-
  decision_tree(
  cost_complexity = tune(),
  tree_depth = tune()
  ) %>%
  set_engine("rpart") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_grid <-  grid_regular(cost_complexity(),
                           tree_depth(),
                           levels=5)

set.seed(345)
tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tune_spec) %>%
  add_formula(class ~.)

tree_res <- tree_wf %>% 
  tune_grid(
    resamples = folds,
    grid = tree_grid
  )
```
Plotting results
```{r}
tree_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  mutate(tree_depth = factor(tree_depth)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(cost_complexity, mean, color = tree_depth)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ .metric, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", begin = .9, end = 0)

tree_res %>%
  show_best("roc_auc")

best_tree <-tree_res %>%
  select_best("roc_auc")

best_tree

final_wf <- tree_wf %>%
  finalize_workflow(best_tree)
```

Exploring the results

```{r}
final_tree <- final_wf %>%
  fit(data = cell_train)

final_tree

#looking at variable importance

final_tree %>%
  pull_workflow_fit()%>%
  vip()

final_fit <- 
  final_wf %>%
  last_fit(cell_split) #this last_fit function will fit the split data training set and then evaluate on the split data test set.

final_fit %>%
  collect_metrics()
#> # A tibble: 2 x 4
#>   .metric  .estimator .estimate .config             
#>   <chr>    <chr>          <dbl> <chr>               
#> 1 accuracy binary         0.802 Preprocessor1_Model1
#> 2 roc_auc  binary         0.860 Preprocessor1_Model1

final_fit %>%
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(class, .pred_PS) %>% 
  autoplot()
```
